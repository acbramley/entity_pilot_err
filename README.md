# Entity Pilot ERR Integration

Provides integration between the Entity Reference Revisions module and Entity Pilot by allowing ERR field values to be denormalized using the unsaved uuid resolver.

Adds a special normalizer to add a target_uuid to the parent_id field of paragraphs so they are deployable.
